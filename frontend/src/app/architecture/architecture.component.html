        This simple-looking architecture utilizes serverless AWS services to scale up with very high demand to ensure a
        great and consistent user experience,
        and scale down with very low demand to minimize costs.

        We start by hosting the website's static content on s3 for reliable and flexible long-term storage.
        When a user requests the webpage, they are first routed though cloudfront. Cloudfront is a global caching
        service, allowing quick access from anywhere in the world.
        Cloudfront returns the cached website, minimizing the calls to the s3 host, and drastically improving loading
        times for users far away from the region of the s3 host.
        <br /><br />
        When the user types their message to translate, the backend Lambda is called. This in turn utilizes AWS's
        Translate service, and returns the translated message.
        Cloudfront caches this translation, saving all the processing delay and costs of calling AWS Translate again the
        next time the user enters the same message.

        Cloudformation is a powerful tool for mangaging infrastructure. We declare our services, and it manages their lifecycle.
        When a merge request is completed, github actions builds and deploys our code and resources.
